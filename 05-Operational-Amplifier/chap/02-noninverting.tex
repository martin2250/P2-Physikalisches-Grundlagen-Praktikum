\autoref{schem:non_inv} shows the schematic of a non-inverting OpAmp.
As both inputs of the OpAmp virtually are at the same potential, the amplification can be calculated easily by using the voltage divider formula (as seen in \autoref{eq:bias_volt})
\begin{align*}
	U_\text{e}&=U_\text{a}\cdot\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} \\
	\Leftrightarrow\ A &=1+\frac{R_2}{R_1}.
\end{align*}
To examine the validity of this relation, the circuit is built and the output voltage is measured as a function of the input voltage.
The resulting curves are shown in \autoref{subfig:non_inv_curve}.

		{$U_\text{pp,in}$ in $\si{\milli\volt}$}&	{$U_\text{pp,out}$ in $\si{\volt}$}&	{$A$}\\

		\num{55.2}	&	\num{0.608}	&	\num{11.01}\\
		\num{352}	&	\num{3.96}	&	\num{11.25}\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
In both measurements, the gain is $\approx 11$, which confirms the expectations.

\section{Input And Output Impedances}

	\label{fig:shitty}
\end{figure}
An ideal OpAmp has an infinitely high input and a low output impedance.
The circuits in \autoref{fig:shitty} shall demonstrate if those ideals are met.

The circuit shown in \autoref{schem:shitty_circuit_1} is used to measure the OpAmp's input impedance.
The formula provided in the preparation file does not take into account that the oscilloscope used for measuring $U_\text{M}$ has the same input impedance as \comp{R_M}.
To examine the effect of non-negligable oscilloscope impedances, the small signal behavior of this circuit has to be considered.
It holds
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{U_\text{e}}{U_\text{M}}=\frac{R_\text{in}+R_\text{M}}{R_\text{M}},
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
	R_\text{in}=R_\text{osc.}\| R_\text{in,op}.
\end{equation*}
Rearranging these equations and plugging in the measured voltage $U_\text{M}=\SI{1.12}{\volt}$ and known resistances, the input impedance can be calculated as
\begin{equation*}
	X=\SI{11.2}{\mega\ohm},
\end{equation*}
which confirms our expectations of a high input impedance.

To measure the output impedance, the circuit shown in \autoref{schem:shitty_circuit_2} is built.
The potentiometer is tuned so that the output signal is halved, its tuned value then approximately equals the output impedance of the OpAmp.
A value of $R_\text{out}=\SI{90}{\ohm}$ is determined, which confirms our expectations of a low output impedance.

\section{Frequency Response}

		\label{fig:noninvert_distortion}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:noninvert_amp} shows the frequency response curve of the non-inverting amplifier.
As expected, gain decreases with growing frequency, where the cutoff frequency roughly is $f_\text{cutoff}\approx\SI{61}{\kilo\hertz}$ ($\SI{-3}{\decibel}$).
\autoref{fig:noninvert_distortion} demonstrates that the output is distorted at high frequencies.
This behavior can be explained by an inertia of the OpAmp, which cannot \todo{regulate gate voltages, i know this is not exactly what happens but it's just physicists, feel free to reword} fast enough internally when frequencies are \todo{OVER 9000!}, so the output is delayed relative to the input and a square wave input signal effectively can be put out as a triangle signal, albeit the amplifier not being operated as an integrator.
