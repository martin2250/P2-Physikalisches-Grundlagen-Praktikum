\end{figure}
\autoref{schem:non_inv} shows the schematic of a non-inverting opamp.
As both inputs of the opamp virtually are at the same potential, the amplification can be calculated easily by using the voltage divider formula (as seen in \autoref{eq:bias_volt})
\begin{align*}
	U_\text{e}&=U_\text{a}\cdot\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} \\
	\Leftrightarrow\ A &=1+\frac{R_2}{R_1}.
\end{align*}
To examine the validity of this relation, the circuit is built and the output voltage is measured as a function of the input voltage.
The resulting curves are shown in \autoref{subfig:non_inv_curve}.

In both measurements, the gain is $\approx 11$, which confirms the expectations.

\section{Input And Output Impedances}

\end{figure}
An ideal opamp has an infinitely high input and a low output impedance.
The circuits in \autoref{fig:shitty} shall demonstrate if those ideals are met.

The circuit shown in \autoref{schem:shitty_circuit_1} is used to naively measure the opamp's input impedance.
The formula provided in the preparation file does not take into account that the oscilloscope used for measuring $U_\text{M}$ has the same input impedance as \comp{R_M}.
To examine the effect of non-negligable oscilloscope impedances, the small signal behavior of this circuit has to be considered.
It holds
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{U_\text{e}}{U_\text{M}}=\frac{R_\text{in}+R_\text{M}}{R_\text{M}},
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
	R_\text{in}=R_\text{osc.}\| R_\text{in,op}.
\end{equation*}
Rearranging these equations and using the measured voltage $U_\text{M}=\SI{1.12}{\volt}$ and known resistances, the input impedance can be calculated as
\begin{equation*}
	R_\text{in,op}=\SI{11.2}{\mega\ohm},
\end{equation*}
which confirms our expectations of a high input impedance.
This measurement is very unreliable, as the measured impedance is more than an order of magnitude greater than the impedance of the oscilloscope parallel to the input.

More importantly, the input of the opamp can absolutely not be modelled as a simple resistor.
Because of the nature of the differential input stage, it acts more like a constant current source/sink.
This also means that a single resistance is worthless when classifying the input characteristics.	%yes, worthless :D
For an actual characterization, both the bias current and the differential impedance ($\rightarrow$ impedance of the current source) have to be taken into account.

To (naively) measure the output impedance, the circuit shown in \autoref{schem:shitty_circuit_2} is built.
The potentiometer is tuned so that the output signal is halved, its value then approximately equals the output impedance of the opamp.
A value of $R_\text{out}=\SI{90}{\ohm}$ is determined, which confirms our expectations of a low output impedance.

This measurement does also not take into account the behavior of the circuit.
The reduced output voltage is not a voltage drop across an impedance, it is an effect of a protection mechanism, which limits the output current of the opamp.
The actual (DC and AC at low frequencies) output impedance is lower by orders of magnitude due to the closed feedback loop.

\section{Frequency Response}
\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{./data/plots/2_3.pdf}
	\caption{Amplification $A$ over Frequency $f$}
	\label{fig:noninvert_amp}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:noninvert_amp} shows the frequency response curve of the non-inverting amplifier.
As expected, gain decreases with growing frequency, where the cutoff frequency roughly is $f_\text{cutoff}\approx\SI{61}{\kilo\hertz}$ ($\SI{-3}{\decibel}$).
Small distortions can be observed at high frequencies (no illustrations available).
Thus the opamp acts as a low-pass filter.
This is mostly an undesired effect due to parasitic capacitances, inductances and limited slew rate, but it is also needed to prevent overshoot and high frequency oscillations from occuring.
