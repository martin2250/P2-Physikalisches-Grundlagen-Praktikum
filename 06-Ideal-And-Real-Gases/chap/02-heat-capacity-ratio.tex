\chapter{Heat Capacity Ratio $\kappa$}

Adiabatic processes in ideal gases can be described with the polytropic process equations
\begin{equation}
	pV^\kappa = \text{const} \quad \text{and} \quad TV^{\kappa - 1} = \text{const},
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = \frac{c_\text{p}}{c_\text{v}}$ is the ratio of the specific heat capacities for constant pressure and volume.

In this experiment $\kappa$ is determined using the method described by Clément-Desormes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A sealed constainer is pressurized and let cool down to ambient temperature\\
	\mbox{$\rightarrow (p_0 + dp_1, V_0, T_0)$}
	\item The container is opened briefly to let the pressure escape\\
	\mbox{$\rightarrow (p_0, V_0, T_0 - dT)$}
	\item The gas that was cooled down in the expansion process heats up to room temperature again\\
	\mbox{$\rightarrow (p_0 + dp_2, V_0, T_0)$}
\end{itemize}
The $p(V)$ diagram of this process is shown in \autoref{fig:pv-clement-method}.

Assuming $dp_x \ll p_0$, $\kappa$ can be calculated\footnote{Vorbereitungshilfe zum Versuch „Ideales und Reales Gas“} as
\begin{equation}
	\kappa = \frac{dp_1}{dp_1 - dp_2} = \frac{dh_1}{dh_1 - dh_2},
\end{equation}
where $dh_x$ denotes the height difference of the fluid levels in the two arms of the manometer, the density of the used liquid cancels out.

In this very much simplified equation, only the read-off error must be considered.
As the manometer was levelled with a bubble level and the two arms of the u tube are very close together, any systematic offset of pressures is small enough to be disregarded.
For the statistical read-off error on $dh_x$ an error of \SI{2}{\milli\meter} is assumed, the errors on $dh_1$ and $dh_2$ are combined with gaussian error propagation.

The experiment is repeated three times with varying initial pressure $dp_1$.
The values along with individual results for $\kappa$ and associated uncertainties are listed in \autoref{tab:kappa}.

The mean value is $\bar{\kappa} = \num{1.27(2)}$, which deviates from the literature value\footnote{\url{webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/fluid/}} of $\kappa_\text{lit} = \num{1.40}$ ($\text{N}_2$ at \SI{20}{\celsius}) by \SI{10}{\percent}.

This is probably due to the slow venting process, where a lot of pressure that comes from re-heating the gas to ambient temperature is lost.
This is confirmed by a second experiment where the vent is purposefully left open for longer than neccessary.
The resulting pressure $dp_2$ is significantly smaller than in the previous tests.
The low variance between the results implicates a very consistent venting process which, being carried out by hand, was not expected.
