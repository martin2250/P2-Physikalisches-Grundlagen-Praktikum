\chapter{Holography}
The two demonstrations were already set up, so no adjustments were neccessary.

\section*{Demo 1: Through Light Hologram}
A phtotographic plate with a hologram is placed in the path of an expanded laser beam, the hologram is visible by looking through the plate at the light source.
The depicted object, an old \todo{car?}, is clearly visible and can be viewed from different angles by moving one's head.

\section*{Demo 2: Reflected Light Hologram}
The plate is illuminated by an incandescent lamp and is viewed from the side of the light source.
Again, the car is visible from different angles.
The car takes on different colors, depending on the angle from which it is looked at.
This is due to the fact that different wavelengths are refracted to different angles, and the eye only covers a small angle as seen from the plate.
