\chapter{Gas Discharge}

A glass tube with two electrodes at either end is connected to the vacuum system.
The high voltage power supply provides a voltage of $\SI{\sim10}{\kV}$ to the electrodes.
The pressure is slowly lowered from atmospheric to the rotary pump's minimum pressure, the receiver stays connected to slow down this process.
