\chapter{Hallwachs Effect}

One of the early experiments demonstrating the photoelectric effect, first carried out by \texttt{Wilhelm Hallwachs}, is repeated.

A zinc plate is sanded to remove contaminations and surface oxide layers.
It is connected to an electrometer and charged up negatively with a high-voltage DC power supply set to \SI{2}{\kV}.

In (artificial) ambient light the electrometer shows no visible change in potential.
The plate is then illuminated with a mercury vapor lamp.
The electrometer's deflection quickly decays.
