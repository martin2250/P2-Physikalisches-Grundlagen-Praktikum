\chapter{Hallwachs Effect}

One of the early experiments demonstrating the photoelectric effect, first carried out by \texttt{Wilhelm Hallwachs}, is repeated.

A zinc plate is sanded to remove contaminations and surface oxide layers.
It is connected to an electrometer and charged up negatively with \SI{2}{\kV} relative to earth ground.

In (artificial) ambient light the electrometer shows no visible change in potential.
The plate is then illuminated with a mercury vapor lamp.
The electrometer's deflection quickly decays.

An additional positively charged electrode can be used to collect the freed electrons and speed up the discharge process.
