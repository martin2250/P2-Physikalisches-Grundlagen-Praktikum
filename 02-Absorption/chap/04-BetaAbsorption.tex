The absorption of beta radiation in aluminum is analyzed by placing a Sr-90 beta source at a fixed distance in front of the tube and placing aluminum sheets of varying thickness between them.

Sr-90 produces a daughter isotope, Y-90, in it's decay. Y-90 is also unstable and decays with a half life time of $\tau_\text{Y-90} = \SI{64}{\hour}$.
As the provided samples are older than the half life time of Sr-90 ($\tau_\text{Sr-90} = \SI{28.2}{a}$), which is also four orders of magnitude greater than that of Y-90, the amount of Y-90 should have reached a nearly stable value, so the activity rates of Y-90 and Sr-90 should be roughly identical.

The literature values for the kinetic energy of the electrons released in the decay are
\begin{equation*}
	E_\text{Sr-90} = \SI{540}{\keV} \qquad \text{and} \qquad E_\text{Y-90} = \SI{2.286}{\MeV}.
\end{equation*}

\autoref{fig:beta_absorption} shows the data, corrected for background level, tube dead time and the additional attenuation from the tube window, which is roughly equal to \SI{12}{\micro\meter} of aluminum.
The last two data points are not used for fitting the model, since the rate only follows the exponential relationship up to \SI{\sim50}{\percent} absorption.
As hinted by the instructions, the attenuation is modelled as a sum of two exponential decays
\begin{equation*}
	N(d) = A_1 e^{-b_1 \cdot d} + A_2 e^{-b_2 \cdot d},
\end{equation*}
resulting in the parameters
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	A_1 &= \SI{32.4}{\cps} \qquad b_1 &= \SI{8.789}{\milli\meter^{-1}}\\
	\text{and } A_2 &= \SI{36.0}{\cps} \qquad b_2 &= \SI{1.172}{\milli\meter^{-1}},
\end{alignat*}
where $A_i$ is the activity of the element and $b_i$ is the coefficient of absorption for the respective energy.
The similar base activities $A_1$ and $A_2$ confirm that the amount of Y-90 should be nearly stable.

The first set of parameters can be identified with the radiation emitted by the decay of Sr-90 and the second set of parameters describes the more energetic radiation emitted by it's daugher isotope Y-90.

The mass coefficient of absorption $\mu_i$ is the ratio of $b_i$ and the density of aluminum $\rho_\text{Al} = \SI{2.71}{\gram\per\cubic\centi\meter}$, the fit parameters yield
\begin{equation*}
	\mu_\text{Sr-90} = \SI{3.24}{\meter\squared\per\kilo\gram} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \mu_\text{Y-90} = \SI{0.43}{\meter\squared\per\kilo\gram}.
\end{equation*}
The empirical formula\footnote{Gleason} for calculating the mass coefficient of absorption $\mu$ (in \si{\centi\meter\squared\per\gram}) for beta radiation with kinetic energy $E$ (in \si{\MeV}) is $\mu = 17 E^{-1.43}$.
Using the provided literature values, this formula yields
\begin{equation*}
	\mu_\text{Sr-90, lit} = \SI{4.1}{\meter\squared\per\kilo\gram} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \mu_\text{Y-90, lit} = \SI{0.52}{\meter\squared\per\kilo\gram},
\end{equation*}
which differ from the experimentally determined vaules by \SI{27}{\percent} and \SI{21}{\percent} respectively.

The relatively high deviation is likely due to the difficulty of fitting two very similar functions to the data set.
