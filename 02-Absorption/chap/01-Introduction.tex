\chapter{Introduction}

The following experiments will explore the capabilities of various materials to absorb different types of ionizing radiation.

\section{Types of ionizing radiation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{$\upalpha$-radiation} is a form of particle radiation consisting of helium-4 nuclei.
	Due to it's size and strong +2 charge, it interacts readily with other matter and has a low penetration depth.
	\item \textbf{$\upbeta$-radiation}, more specifically $\upbeta^{-}$-radiation, consists of high-energy electrons.
	Often a product of $\upbeta^{-}$ decay, it is created when a neutron decays into a proton, an electron and an electron neutrino.
	Like $\upalpha$-radiation, the particles carry a charge, though the much smaller cross section gives them an increased penetration depth compared to $\upalpha$ particles.
	\item \textbf{$\upgamma$-radiation} is electromagnetic radiation with energies upwards of \SI{100}{\kilo\electronvolt}.
	Unlike $\upalpha$ and $\upbeta$ particles, photons do not carry a charge and thus interact most weakly with other matter.
\end{itemize}

\section{Absorption characteristics of radiation types}
There is a fundamental in the way charged and neutral particles interact with regular matter.

Charged particles like electrons give off their energy through many interactions by ionizing other atoms, elastic collisions or Coulomb scattering.
This leads to a linear relationship between particle energy and distance travelled and notably dictates that charged particles can be shielded entirely.

Photons, on the other hand, tend to give off their energy in single bursts, by the photoelectric effect and pair production, or also by compton scattering.
This leads to an exponential decrease in radiation dose with thicker shields and implies that $\upgamma$-radiation can never be entirely blocked off.

All interactions between radiation and matter get stronger with increased atomic mass of the absorbing material.
This makes heavy elements, such as lead, very popular for radiation shields.

\section{Measurement of radiation}
The most common method of detecting ionizing particles is to exploit their ionizing properties to create ion-electron pairs.
This is the method used in Geiger–Müller tubes
In a sufficiently strong electric field, the pairs will seperate and accelerate towards the anode/cathode.
If the electrons get enough energy, they can ionize secondary atoms.
The resulting avalanche effect amplifies the released charge by a factor of up to $10^8$.
This large charge can be measured as a current spike, which makes it possible to count individual particles.

To prevent a runaway gas discharge induced by the positive feedback from damaging the equipment or blocking out further particles, the discharge is quenched.
Still, the discharge takes a finite time ('dead time') in which the tube can not detect new particles.
