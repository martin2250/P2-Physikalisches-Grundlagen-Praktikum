This experiment deals with absorption of gammas emitted by radioisotopes Co-60 and Cs-137.

To measure the behavior of absorption in plumbum, a block of it is placed between a Co-60 source and the Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube, graudually increasing the block's thickness.
Once again, background radiation is subtracted from the number of measured events.
Dead time of the tube does not have to be considered, as the tube is operated within the pleateau region.

\autoref{fig:gamma_pb} depicts the measured data and confirms the \textbf{law of absorption}
\begin{equation*}
	N\propto e^{-b*d}.
\end{equation*}

Fit parameters are
\begin{gather*}
	a=\num{3.76}cps\qquad b=\SI{0.05}{\milli\meter}^{-1}.
\end{gather*}

$b$ can be identified with the coefficient of absorption, which can be plugged into
\begin{equation*}
	\alpha=\frac{b}{\rho_\text{Pb}}
\end{equation*}
to calculate the \todo{mass-coefficient of absorption?}.
Using
\begin{equation*}
	d_\text{hvl}=\frac{\log{2}}{\alpha}.
\end{equation*}
