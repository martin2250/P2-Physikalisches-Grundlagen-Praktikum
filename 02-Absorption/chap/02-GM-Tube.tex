\chapter{Geiger-Mueller tube characteristics}
\section{Operating voltage}
To determine the optimal operating voltage of the two provided tubes, the count rate is measured for operating voltages between \SI{300}{\volt} and \SI{450}{\volt}, with equal radiation exposure from an $^{90}$Sr beta source.
\autoref{fig:GM-curves} shows the resulting characteristic curves.
Both show the Geiger plateau clearly, however the weak pulses produced by the other operating modes were not recorded by the pulse counter.

The tube used in the left setup shows a slope of \SI{0.11}{\cps\per\volt} in the plateau region, the right tube shows a slope of \SI{0.13}{\cps\per\volt}.
For all further experiments, operating voltages of \SI{450}{\volt} for the left setup, and \SI{380}{\volt} for the right setup were chosen.

\section{Radiation Background}
All artificial sources of radiation are stored behind lead shields in order to determine the natural background radiation level.
To get a realiable rate from such infrequent events, a long gate time of \SI{5}{\second} and a total run time of \todo{...} were used.
The measured values are listed in \autoref{tab:background}.

	\end{tabular}

\section{Dead Time}
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:geiger_shit}, the depletion of electrons prevent other incident particles to induce any gas discharges for a certain amount of time because induced positive ions have to migrate to the kathode (wall of the tube) first in order to make other avalanches possible.
This time is called \textbf{dead time} $\tau_\text{dead}$.

Dead time can be determined by a two-preparation method for which the formula \footnote{Source: Excercise descr.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dead_time}
	\tau_\text{dead} = \frac{T}{N_{12}}\left(1-\sqrt{1-\left(N_1+N_2-N_{12}\right)\cdot\frac{N_{12}}{N_1N_2}}\right)
\end{equation}
holds.

Utilizing \autoref{eq:dead_time} dead time is calculated as
\begin{gather*}
 	\tau_\text{dead,l}=\SI{263.4}{\micro\second}\qquad \tau_\text{dead,r}=\SI{211.6}{\micro\second}
\end{gather*}
for each setup (left-right).

These dead times are needed for corrections of subsequent experiments.
It holds
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dead_time_corr}
	R_\text{corr}=\frac{R}{1-R\cdot\tau_\text{dead}}.
\end{equation}

\section{Inverse Square Law}
The validity of the inverse square law is tested by placing a radiation source in front of the tube and measuring the acitivity at various positions.
To minimize the attenuation due to absorption, which does not follow the inverse square law, gamma radiation from a Co-60 is used.

\autoref{fig:invsq} shows the results of the measurements in a log-log-graph.
A linear fit is applied, and the calculted slope is \num{-2.1}.

The inverse square law holds.
