\chapter{Geiger-Mueller tube characteristics}
\section{Operating voltage}
To determine the optimal operating voltage of the two provided tubes, the count rate is measured for operating voltages between \SI{300}{\volt} and \SI{450}{\volt}, with equal radiation exposure from an $^{90}$Sr beta source.
\autoref{fig:GM-curves} shows the resulting characteristic curves.
Both show the Geiger plateau clearly, however the weak pulses produced by the other operating modes were not recorded by the pulse counter.

The tube used in the left setup shows a slope of \SI{0.11}{\cps\per\volt} in the plateau region, the right tube shows a slope of \SI{0.13}{\cps\per\volt}.
For all further experiments, operating voltages of \SI{450}{\volt} for the left setup, and \SI{380}{\volt} for the right setup were chosen.

\section{Radiation Background}
All artificial sources of radiation are stored behind lead shields in order to determine the natural background radiation level.
To get a realiable rate from such infrequent events, a long gate time of \SI{5}{\second} and a total run time of \todo{...} were used.
The measured values are listed in \autoref{tab:background}.

\section{Dead Time}
The incidence of radiation particles into the Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube causes creation of secondary electrons, which are accelerated by the potential difference between the tube wire and wall.
During their migration towards the anode of the tube, they cause so called electron avalanches caused by the stimulation of filling gas atoms, which in turn emit photons of UV wavelengths.
These photons interact with other filling gas atoms through the photoelectric effect and thus emit more electrons, which are accelerated towards the anode, too, and the cycle repeats from there.
The perpetual creation and migration of electrons to the anode causes positively charged ions to stay behind at the tube wire which alter the potential difference in this area in a manner that lead to collapse of avalanches.
These ions prevent other incident particles to induce any gas discharges for a certain amount of time because they have to migrate to the kathode (wall of the tube) first in order to make other avalanches possible.
This time is called \textbf{dead time} $\tau_\text{dead}$.

Dead time can be determined by a two-preparation method for which the formulae
\begin{equation*}
	R_\text{corr}=\frac{R}{1-R\cdot\tau_\text{dead}}-R_\text{back}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
	\tau_\text{dead}=\frac{A\cdot\left(1-\sqrt{1-C}\right)}{B}
\end{equation*}
hold, where $R_\text{back}$ denotes background radiation rate and
\begin{align*}
	A &= R_1R_2-R_\text{back}R_{12}= \\
	B &= R_1R_2\cdot\left(R_{12}+R_\text{back}\right)-R_{12}R_\text{back}\cdot\left(R_1+R_2\right)= \\
	C &= \frac{B\cdot\left(R_1+R_2-R_{12}-R_\text{back}\right)}{A^2}=
\end{align*}

\section{Inverse Square Law}
The validity of the inverse square law is tested by placing a radiation source in front of the tube and measuring the acitivity at various positions.
To minimize the attenuation due to absorption, which does not follow the inverse square law, gamma radiation is used.

\autoref{fig:invsq} shows the results of the measurements in a log-log-graph.
A linear fit is applied, and the calculted slope is \num{-2.1}.

The inverse square law holds.
