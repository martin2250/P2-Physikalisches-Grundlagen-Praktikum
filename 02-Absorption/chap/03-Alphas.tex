This experiment addresses the distance behavior of alpha radiation emitted by the radioactive isotope Am-241.

The fundamental processes responsible for alpha decay are a balance of nuclear and electromagnetic force.
While the Coulomb force is repelling the alpha particle from the rest of the nucleus, it is restrained from the nuclear force.
Altough in classical mechanics the alpha particle doesn't have enough energy to escape from the potential well, the quantum tunneling effect allows the alpha to escape and after some time it does.

To measure the amount of alpha radiation in dependence of the distance $d$ the alpha-source Am-241 is placed in front of a Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube and moved away from it in \SI{1}{\milli\meter} intervals.
A few corrections have to be took into consideration before the measurements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Background radiation} The previously measured background radiation has to be substracted from the actual measurement.
	\item \textbf{Changing solid angle} With changing distance the solid angle of radiation changes. It holds $R_\text{corr}=\frac{4r^2}{d^2}R_\text{meas}$, where $r$ and $d$ denote the radius of the tube and the distance respectively.
	\item \textbf{Parasitic gamma radiation} Am-241 not only radiates alphas but also gammas. The percentage\footnote{Source: www.nucleide.org/DDEP\_WG/NUCLIDES/AM-241\_tables.pdf} of emitted alphas is $\num{98}\%$, hence $R_\text{corr}=0.98\cdot R_\text{meas}$.
\end{itemize}

Unlike betas and gammas alphas can be completely blocked off after a certain distance.
\autoref{fig:alpha_distance} shows the results of the measurements after aforementioned corrections.
A small anomaly can be seen at $d_\text{max}=\SI{16.25}{\milli\meter}$ which can be interpreted as the maximal distance the alphas can travel before ionizing completely.
This also confirms our expectations, as alpha particles interact strongly with matter and thus do not travel for very long distances.
The measured low-level radiation from $d_\text{max}$ until the end most likely originates from extraordinarily energized alphas or even secondary gammas, which could not be accounted for through a statistical estimation.

The quality of the experiment could have benefitted by condcucting a reference experiment with a sheet of paper between tube and source.
Like this, all alphas would have been shieled from the tube and only the secondary gammas could have been measured to subtract from the original experiment's data later on.
