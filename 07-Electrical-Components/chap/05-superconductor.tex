\chapter{Superconductivity}
This experiment explores superconductivity.

\section{Theory}
Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, in which the so called \textbf{superconductor}'s electrical resistance abruptly decreases to exactly zero when cooled below their so called \textbf{critical temperature}.
For example an electric current flowing through a superconductor loop can persist infinitely long without a power source whatsoever.
Furthermore, superconductors expel any magnetic fields from them, which is called the \texttt{Meissner-Ochsenfeld}-effect.
Until 1986, physicists believed that superconductivity is not possible to occur above \SI{30}{\kelvin}.
However \texttt{Bednorz} and \texttt{MÃ¼ller} (nobel prize 1987) proved this statement to be wrong by first finding that a lanthanum-based cuprate perovskite material had its critical temperature at \SI{35}{\kelvin}.
It could further be raised by replcaing the lanthanum by yttrium, which raised the critical temperature to \SI{92}{\kelvin}\cite{PhysRevLett.58.908}.
This marked the birth of high temperature superconductors.
A big advantage over ordinary superconductors is that they can be cooled with liquid nitrogen, which is widely available.

\section{Experimental Setup}
A container is filled halfway with liquid nitrogen (\SI{77}{\kelvin}).
This will result in a temperature gradient right above the liquids surface that can be used to cool down the high temperature superconductor sample.
The voltage drop of the material is measured with a four-wire connection, which cancels out any resistance of the wires and allows for high precision.
By slowly lowering the superconductor into the temperature gradient, it can be cooled down in a controlled manner.
%Multiple test series are necessary to guarantee optimal data resolution. //'controlled manner' makes the sentence obsolete...
A constant current of \SI{63}{\mA} is applied to the sample.
By measuring the voltage drop across the sense terminals, the material's resistance can be calculated using Ohm's law.

\autoref{fig:superconductor} shows the resistance over temperature curve for a non-specified high temperature superconductor.
The critical temperature is approximately \SI{148}{\kelvin}.
The resistance edge is clearly visible at this temperature which confirms our expectations.
