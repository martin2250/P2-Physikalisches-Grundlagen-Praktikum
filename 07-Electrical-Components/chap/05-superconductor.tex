\chapter{Superconductivity}
This experiment explores superconductivity.

\section{Theory}
Superconductivity is a quantum mechanical phenomenon, in which the so called \textbf{superconductor}'s electrical resistance abruptly decreases to exactly zero when cooled below their so called \textbf{critical temperature}.
For example an electric current flowing through a superconductor loop can persist infinitely long without a power source whatsoever.
Furthermore, superconductors expel any magnetic fields from them, which is called the \texttt{Meissner-Ochsenfeld}-effect.
Until 1986, physicists believed that superconductivity is not possible to occur above \SI{30}{\kelvin}.
However \texttt{Bednorz} and \texttt{MÃ¼ller} (nobel prize 1987) proved this statement to be wrong by first finding that a lanthanum-based cuprate perovskite material had its critical temperature at \SI{35}{\kelvin}.
It could further be raised by replcaing the lanthanum by yttrium, which raised the critical temperature to \SI{92}{\kelvin}\cite{PhysRevLett.58.908}.
This marked the birth of high temperature superconductors.
A big advantage over ordinary superconductors is that they can be cooled with liquid nitrogen, which is widely available.

\section{Experimental Setup}
A container is filled half with liquid nitrogen (\SI{77}{\kelvin}).
This will result in a temperature gradient right above the liquids surface that can be used to cool down the high temperature superconductor in question.
The voltage drop of the material is four-wire measured, which allows for high precision.
By lowering the superconductor gradually into the temperature gradient, it can be cooled down in a controlled manner.
However, for low temperatures the material has to be dipped into the liquid, which speeds up the temperature decrease drastically.
Therefore, multiple test series are necessary to guarantee optimal data resolution.

\autoref{fig:superconductor} shows the resistance over temperature curve for a non-specified high temperature superconductor.
The critical temperature is approximately \SI{148}{\kelvin}.
The resistance edge is clearly visible at this temperature which confirms our expectations.
